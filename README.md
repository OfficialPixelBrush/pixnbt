# pixnbt
A C++ native NBT library

This is partially based on the NBT Classes Mojang provided with the [McRegion to Anvil Converter](https://web.archive.org/web/20140807224955/http://assets.minecraft.net/12w07a/Minecraft.AnvilConverter.zip) released by Mojang on [February 14th, 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20120302221152/http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/new-minecraft-map-format-anvil), as it comes with both a .jar and source code.

This project is mostly meant for [BetrockServer](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer).
